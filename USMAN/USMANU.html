                The Department of Forestry and Environment at Usmanu Danfodiyo University, Sokoto, began its journey
                in the 1980/81 academic session as part of the University's comprehensive agricultural training,
                integrating Forestry and Fisheries. Initially, the University's agricultural curriculum stood out for
                incorporating these components, offering a distinctive approach compared to other institutions in
                the country. The National Universities Commission (NUC) introduced Approved Minimum Standards for
                Agriculture, Forestry, Fisheries, and Home Economics in 1989. Consequently, the University adopted
                the general Agriculture curriculum in the 1989/90 session, introducing two courses (one each in
                Forestry and Fisheries) at the 300 level. The old agriculture program concluded in the 1993/94
                session.
            </p>
            <p>
                Recognizing the vital role of Forestry and Fisheries in food production, especially in Northern
                Nigeria, the Senate approved undergraduate programs in Bachelor of Forestry (B. Forestry) and
                Bachelor of Fisheries (B. Fisheries) in April 1996. These programs officially commenced in the
                1999/2000 academic session. In the last quarter of 2014, the department underwent bifurcation,
                resulting in two distinct programs: Forestry and Environment, and Fisheries and Aquaculture,
                effective August 2014.
