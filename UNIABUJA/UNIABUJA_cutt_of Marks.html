                <strong>UNIABUJA Departmental Cut Off Mark</strong><br><br>
                This is purely based on the department or course involved. The UNIABUJA courses and cut off mark for admission is not static and it's influenced by the following:<br><br>
                - The admission cut off mark for a course is determined by the general performance of candidates in both the SSCE, JAMB, and Post UTME. The final admission cut off mark is derived from the Pounds to Naira conversion (Grade Points from the Relevant O’Level Subjects) WAEC/NECO/NABTEB GPA.<br><br>
                - Between the post-UTME screening score and the JAMB score, average.<br><br>
                - Admissions Cap.<br><br>
                - Admission quota for the department: The Nigerian University Commission (NUC) allots admission quotas for each department. For instance, if the department’s admission quota for medicine and surgery is 100, no matter the candidate’s score, the department will not accept any further applicants for admission after the slot is filled. In this instance, the university admits applicants based on a hierarchy of merit (from the best applicant down to the point at which the quota is filled).<br><br>
                - The University of Abuja gives preference to applicants from its catchment areas, which are the states nearest to the institution in terms of geography or ethnic group. Currently, the catchment area is divided into 6 states.<br><br>
