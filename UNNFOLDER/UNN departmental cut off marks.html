    <p>Just to bring to your notice that students who took the just concluded 2022/2023 UNN post UTME screening should scroll below this page and check the cutoff mark for their courses.</p>

    <div class="alert alert-danger">
      <strong>NOTE:</strong> The University of Nigeria does not publish departmental cutoff marks on its website anymore. The reason for this is unknown. However, all the faculties in the school still release cutoff marks locally for aspirants to see. Only students who are inside the school can verify this. Thus, do not expect to see the cutoff mark here in the official UNN website. We get all our information from a reliable source in the university.

    <p>As a freshman (New student, or year one students) who do not know what UNN cut off Mark is. This is to inform you that the cut off Marks are stipulated scores that determine your chances of being admitted into the university. But if by chance you are unable to meet up with the school cut off Marks for the year, on a particular course, you may have a limited chance of getting admitted to study the course of your choice.</p>

    <p><strong>Read:</strong> <span id="c">Is it possible to gain admission into UNN without meeting the Cutoff mark?</span> Well, you know that anything is possible in this world, especially our country Nigeria. Once you have the money and connection, you might still get admitted by the University of Nsukka (UNN).</p>

    <p>Nonetheless, on a fair basis, if you don’t meet the institution’s cutoff mark for any year, you may not be able to gain admission for that year unless you have an upper hand. UNN releases multiple admission lists after the first batch, including second, third, and sometimes even fourth admission lists. In all, it takes only luck to gain admission into UNN without meeting the university’s admission cutoff marks.</p>

    <p>If you are interested in knowing if you still have chances to be admitted with low cutoff marks:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Apply for UNN shopping form: This is the best thing to do if you did not meet the requirements for your course. UNN shopping form is simply a form sold at N3,000 by the university management that allows applicants to change their course in situations where they are unable to meet the requirements to study their course of choice. However, note that you can't purchase the shopping form for top courses like law, medicine, and surgery, pharmacy, and so on.</li>
      <li>Wait for the supplementary admission list: Another option is to wait and hope for the institution to release its supplementary admission list. It's mostly for students who performed very well in their JAMB & Post UTME and are admitted through this list. If you are among the ELS of UNN, you might also be considered for admission.</li>
      <li>Change the course or university: It doesn’t have to be UNN; there are other universities out there that accept lower cutoff marks. Don't be keen on going to a particular university. All you have to do is apply for JAMB change of course and institution form, which is just N2500 only.</li>
      <li>Apply next year: The last option available here is for you to apply for admission next year. Actually, this is a bad option, but you can't kill yourself if UNN refuses to offer you admission. Study harder and prepare for admissions next year.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Meanwhile, the University of Nigeria, Nsukka (UNN), will release its departmental cutoff marks for the 2022/2023 session a few weeks after the post-UTME exam. Continue to visit this page as we will update you once the school departmental cutoff marks are released.</p>

    <p>Also, if you wish to see UNN JAMB and departmental cutoff marks for the previous year (2021), kindly scroll down this page.</p>
