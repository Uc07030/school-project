Accommodation Fee
The accommodation fee is in two categories;
</p>

<p>
  <div class="container mt-5">
    <h2>Explanation of the Above Listed Fees</h2>
    
    <p>
      Acceptance fee is the amount of money you pay to accept your UNN admission. It is the first payment you will make as a student of the University of Nigeria, Nsukka.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      The amount for the UNN acceptance fee is thirty thousand naira (₦30,000).
    </p>
  
    <p>
      Do not pay the acceptance fee using your ATM card. All payments must be at any of the commercial banks in Nigeria. The reason is that the bank teller would be a requirement for your final year clearance.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      School Fees
      School fees are the amount of money you would pay for different charges like ICT, SUG, development fee, etc.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      UNN school fees for freshers is between seventy to eighty thousand naira (₦70,000 – 80,000).
    </p>
  
    <p>
      Note: UNN school fees changes for every academic session.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      Read this post to see the school fees schedule for all the departments in UNN.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      Also, payment for the UNN school fees must be at the commercial bank. Do not make payment with your ATM card.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      UNN Clearance Fee
      The UNN clearance is free of charge.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      You do not pay any money for clearance as a student of the University of Nigeria.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      There are lots of expenses you will make during your clearance. They include the following;
    </p>
  
    <p>
      Passport Photograph
      You need thirty (30) passports for your academic and hostel clearance.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      Also, you will use passports for your manual course registration in UNN.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      Photocopy of Documents
      You need four (4) copies of each of your clearance documents. That is a lot of money.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      I will advise you not to make any clearance expenses at home. Proceed to the university first; there may be some changes to the charges. It is more accurate to verify your clearance payment so as not to make any wrong payment.
    </p>
