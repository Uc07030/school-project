		  <h2>UNN General Admission Requirements - 2022/2023</h2>
		  <p>
			The article discusses the University of Nigeria's (UNN) general admission requirements for the 2022/2023 academic session.
			It emphasizes that beyond cutoff marks, several criteria are considered for admission. These include candidates being at least 16 years old,
			possessing a minimum of five O'level credits, scoring at least 160 in the JAMB UTME examination, performing well in the UNN Post UTME screening,
			and meeting the specified cutoff marks for their chosen courses.
		  </p>
	  
		  <p>
			Furthermore, the article provides a guide on calculating the UNN post UTME aggregate score, highlighting that JAMB contributes 60%, while the Post UTME
			accounts for 40%. It instructs candidates to multiply their JAMB and Post UTME scores by the respective percentages, then combine the results
			to determine their overall UNN post UTME aggregate score.
		  </p>
	  
		  <p>
			In summary, the admission process at UNN involves a holistic assessment of various criteria, and candidates are encouraged to meet both JAMB and Post UTME
			requirements to enhance their chances of admission. The article concludes with an illustrative example to clarify the calculation process.
