    Schedule of Fees
    ALL FEES ARE NOT REFUNDABLE AFTER PAYMENT
    A.	Registration Fees
    Registration fees are reflected on student’s BUKPPF, to be paid using Remita e-Payments and e-Collection platform (click here for the payment procedure). Make sure you carefully read, understand and follow the payment procedure, as BUK will not be liable for any lost of funds as a result of incorrect data entry. Students must make sure that they entered ALL the information of the BUKPPF EXACTLY. Students must also ensure that
    
    Name of MDA
    Name of Service/Purpose
    Description
    Amount to Pay (₦)
    Registration No.
    BUKPPF ID
    Payer’s Full Name
    Payer’s Email
    Payer’s Phone
    Are captured exactly as they are written on the BUKPPF. Note that Payer (Payer’s Full Name, Payer’s Email, Payer’s Phone) means the student, so even if the student is not the one making the payment (payment by proxy) make sure to use the student information. Any misinformation may lead to unnecessary delay in validating and processing of payment. Payments are usually validated and processed within 24/48 hours of making payment.

  <h4>Buk Cut-off Mark</h4>

  <p>
      In this article, I will elaborate more about the Bayero University Kano (BUK) cut-off mark 2023/2024. If
      you’ve been searching for the Bayero University Kano Jamb cut-off mark or its departmental aggregate then I
      guess u are on the right page. This is to inform the general public that the management of the institution
      has announced the 2023/2024 cut-off mark. This cut-off mark is for those that chose BUK as their first choice
      in the last Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME) and those who didn’t choose the school but
      willing to apply for a change of institution. Also, This article will help students preparing for the upcoming
      JAMB & POST UTME examination to know the minimum score expected of them to have before processing admission.
