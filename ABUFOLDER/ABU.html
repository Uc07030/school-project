                Welcome to the Department of Sociology, Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria. The Department believes that its niche
                lies in providing a learning environment in which students acquire:
            </p>
    
            <ul>
                <li>Insights into competing economic theories, underlying values, and methodology.</li>
                <li>Capacity for investigating basic and applied economic phenomena and problems.</li>
                <li>Generalized and specialized problem-solving skills.</li>
                <li>Capacity to start and grow businesses.</li>
                <li>Capacity for public policy analysis.</li>
                <li>Capacity to offer economic advice to economic entities – individuals, households, businesses, governments,
                    and international organizations.</li>
            </ul>
    
            <p>The Department was established in 1967. It has since then, in its teaching and research activities, distinguished

    <h3>Welcome Message:</h3>
    <p>
        The Faculty of Arts, situated at the heart of the Main Campus, Samaru, holds a distinguished position as one
        of the twelve Faculties of Ahmadu Bello University. With roots predating the formal establishment of the
        University, the Faculty played a pivotal role in the administrative and academic growth of the institution.
        The historical connection between the Faculty of Arts and Ahmadu Bello University traces back to the
        conception of a university in Northern Nigeria, following the recommendations of the Ashby Commission on
        Higher Education in Nigeria in 1959. The University, named after Sir Ahmadu Bello, came into existence on
        October 14, 1962, with Zaria chosen as its location due to the concentration of relevant academic institutions
        in the city.
    </p>

    <h3>MISSION:</h3>
    <p>
        To advance learning in the arts and humanities through teaching, research, and dissemination of knowledge of
        the highest quality. The mission also includes establishing national and international integration, developing
        and promoting African traditions and cultures, and producing high-level manpower to respond to community,
        national, and global challenges.
    </p>

    <h3>VISION:</h3>
    <p>
        The Faculty aspires to be a world-class institution, comparable to any other, engaged in imparting knowledge
        in the Arts and Humanities. It aims to achieve this using high-quality facilities and multidisciplinary
        approaches, promoting inclusivity without discrimination based on race, gender, or creed. The vision also
        emphasizes generating new ideas and intellectual practices relevant to the needs of the immediate community,
        Nigeria, and the world.
    </p>

    <h3>PHILOSOPHY:</h3>
    <p>
        As one of the foundational Faculties of Ahmadu Bello University, the Faculty of Arts has been integral to the
        University's administrative development and academic accomplishments. It continues to play a leading role in
        fostering a dynamic and enriching learning environment.
