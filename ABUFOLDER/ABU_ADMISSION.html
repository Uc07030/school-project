            Ahmadu Bello University ABU library
            Kashim Ibrahim Library is an academic library that serves Ahmadu Bello University’s students and academic staff in Zaria, Kaduna.
             It is located on the university’s main campus, with satellite libraries distributed on various academic campuses. The library’s collection includes around 1.2 million books, 66000 titles of journals, online databases, a CD-ROM search room, and a Learning Commons. For successful services to the university community, the Library now contains over ten divisions.
            </p>
             <br>
            Kashim Ibrahim Library was founded in 1955, the same year that the university was founded. It was then a modest room that was later transformed into a staff club. The little library was used until 1963, when a $39,000 modern library was built. The library was named after the state’s then-governor. The library has a capacity of 70000 books and can accommodate 120 people at any given moment. In 1963, the Governor, Sir Kashim Ibrahim, was honored with a library dedicated after him.
