    <p> Ahmadu Bello University Zaria hostel accommodation fee 2022/2023</p>
   
   <p>Hostel accommodation is very competitive. The bed space is relatively small as compared to the number of students in the school. So, it is like survival of the fittest.
     ABU Hostel accommodation fee is a sum of seven thousand five hundred nairas (#7500).
   </p>
   
   <p>
   The Ahmadu Bello University hostel cost is currently N7,500. The fee may change over time, but rest assured that we will keep you informed if it does.
   </p>
   <p>
   Note: Always keep all your receipts (school fees, hostel fee, acceptance fee receipt, etc) intact up till your final year because Ahmadu Bello University (ABU) Zaria will require you of this receipt before you graduate from the school. 
   It is very important if you don’t want unnecessary payment.

   </p>
   <p>
   The School of Postgraduate Studies at the Ahmadu Bello University accommodates the PGD, Masters’, Doctoral, and even Post-Doctoral programmes.

   Acceptance Fees: ABU requested a sum of N50,000 for both Sciences and School of Management Sciences. This is the same amount paid by Post-Graduate Diploma Students.
   Registration Fee: N25, 000 for PGD and Masters, both Sciences and Management Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   School Fees: N150, 000 for Postgraduate Diploma, while Masters students pay between N200,000 and N250,000 depending on the course in ABU. 
   Health, Computer, Examination, and Sports Fees: All of these fees amount to about N120, 000.
