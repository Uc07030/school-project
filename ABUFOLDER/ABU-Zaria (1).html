        The Department of Crop Protection is one of the six Departments in the Faculty of Agriculture of the Ahmadu Bello University. The Department was established 1978. The Department is currently organized into two sections, namely;
         Entomology, and Plant Pathology. The Plant Pathology Section has four research and teaching units, namely; Mycopathology, Phytobacteriology, Plant Virology and Plant Nematology. 
         <SPan id="read3" style=" color: blue;">read more.....</SPan>
         </p>
         <div id="abu-history3"style="display:none">
         The Department also has an Insect Museum that contains a collection of about 70, 000 species of insects as well as a Diagnostic Laboratory and a Culture Room.
          Collaborative researches have been executed in the past and are currently being conducted with both national and international organizations and agencies at either individual levels or departmental level. Crop Protection Department is a productive conglomeration of very strong colleges and schools, and it also is a whole greater than the sum of these parts. The focus of this strategic plan is that “greater sum,” rather than the particular subunits or parts that compose it. The plan proposes Department-wide goals and actions that crosscut or transcend
        </p>
        <p>
          the boundaries of units, laboratories, and administration. It suggests that the Department can take even greater advantage of its distributed strengths while also reinforcing those strengths and facilitating the “bottom-up” blossoming of innovation and creativity characteristic of the units and laboratories.
        The general strategy proposed here for achieving this aspiration is captured by two words: focus and connectivity.
        </p>
    
        <p>
            Focus on strong or potentially strong academic programs that are strategically important to the Department and maintain areas of excellence within each of the basic research groupings—Entomology and Pathology (Mycology, Virology, Bacteriology, Nematology).
        </p>
     
           <div class="container-fluid">
        <p>
        Build greater connectivity among the diverse units and programs around these basic academic areas by developing new integrations, boundary-crossing structures, and productive synergies and also building linkages with associated Departments and Institutes within and outside the University.
